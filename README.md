# Description

User Story - As cryptocurrencies gain popularity, we wanting to give users a simple to use interface that allowed them to keep track of and look back on the history of different tokens.

#### Development Road-map

- Create a easy to navigate UI
- Find and implement a API that displays information about Crypto. For data we used CoinGecko’s api’s, namely: coins_id, trending market_chart and search. <br> We also utilized debounce to delay user search by 500ms increasing site performance, we also used Axios (for Ajax requests), sass(styling), zustand (for state), recharts (for visual graph) and react-router-dom (for routing).
- Once the API was implemented, the application was deployed via Netlify for others to access it.
